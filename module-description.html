<h2>What you will study</h2>
  
<p>
  The module will cover a range of substantive legal principles and the law making framework in England and Wales. Throughout your studies you will develop a number of key legal academic skills and learn to interpret and apply the laws which have been created by the Westminster Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the courts and European institutions.</p>
<p>
  The module begins by asking you to consider the nature and sources of law. Why do we have law and what role does law play. It then examines the fundamental principles which form the UK’s constitution before considering law making in England and Wales. Through your studies of the law making process you will learn about the range of institutions and bodies which have power to make law which impacts directly or indirectly in the UK. &nbsp;You will look at the role of the Westminster Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the wider impact of devolution, secondary legislation and the role of common law. You will also explore the relationship between common law and equity, law making processes in the EU and the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>
  You will then explore how laws are administered and what sanctions can be imposed when laws are broken. Creating law is only one aspect of the legal system and you will consider the importance within a legal system of the administration of justice and the relationship between judicial reasoning, public policy and politics. Fundamental legal concepts will be introduced, such as evidence (burden, proof and truth), legal personality, culpability and liability.</p>
<p>
  Throughout the module you will be asked to think about the role and nature of the law and key legal concepts and the features of a just legal system. &nbsp;An integral aspect of this module is the development of legal and other study skills. These will enhance your ability to reason, explain, and present an argument. They will also enable you to challenge accepted ideas and practices. You will be expected to become a critical thinker and also spend time reflecting on your own learning and progress.</p>
<p>
  The development of skills forms an essential part of legal study and is an integral part of legal study. The thinking, reasoning and organisational skills developed through academic legal study are highly sought after and valued.</p>

    
<h3>You will learn</h3>

<p>
  In addition to the knowledge you will gain from this module you will also develop essential legal study skills. This includes the ability to:</p>

</ul>
<p>
